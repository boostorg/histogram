      Histograms are a basic tool in statistical analysis. When analysing large data
      sets, it is usually more convenient to work with a histogram of the input values.
      Histograms can compactly represent a data set of stochastic variables. If the
      histogram layout is chosen appropriately, any information present in the original
      can also be extracted from the histogram<a href="#ftn.histogram.motivation.f0" class="footnote" name="histogram.motivation.f0"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>; the information loss due to binning is then negligible. Processing
      a histogram is much faster than processing the original data, because the memory
      footprint of a histogram is much smaller. Next to data visualisation, this
      is the main reason to use histograms. In other words, a histogram is a lossy
      compression of statistical data.
    </p>
<p>
      C++ lacks a widely-used, free multi-dimensional histogram class. While it is
      easy to write a one-dimensional histogram, writing a general multi-dimensional
      histogram poses more of a challenge. If you add serialization and Python/Numpy
      support onto the wish-list, then the implementation becomes non-trivial and
      a well-tested library solution desirable.
    </p>
<p>
      The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl" target="_top">GNU Scientific Library (GSL)</a>
      and in the <a href="https://root.cern.ch" target="_top">ROOT framework</a> from CERN
      have histogram implementations. The C implementations of the GSL are elegant,
      but only support one and two dimensions. The implementations are not customizable,
      you have to live with the trade-offs chosen by the implementors. ROOT has implementations
      for one, two, three, and general multi-dimensional histograms. However, the
      implementations are not customizable either, and in addition the interfaces
      are unnecessarily complex and inconsistent, and mix many different responsibilities.
      They are also not safe to use, it is easy to make a mistake. For example, before
      filling the histogram with weighted data, one has to call a special function
      which prepares the histogram for this input. Also, the ROOT design puts the
      burden on the users to decide which data type to use for the bin counts. A
      small integer type reduces the memory footprint, but may overflow.
    </p>
<p>
      The histogram class template in this library has an interface as elegant as
      the GSL implementations. In addition, it is very customizable and extensible
      through policy classes and in the way input values are binned. Thanks to variadic
      templates, the interface remains straight-forward for any number of dimensions.
      While being safe, customizable, and convenient, the histogram is also very
      performant. The static variant, which uses compile-time information wherever
      possible, can be filled twice as fast with input values as the more conventional
      dynamic variant.
    </p>
<p>
      A central design goal was to abstract away details on the internal counters.
      The internal counting mechanism is encapsulated in a storage policy, which
      can be replaced at compile time. The standard policy implements an adaptive
      memory managment which is safe for the user, memory-efficient, and fast. The
      safety comes from the guarantee, that counts cannot overflow or be capped.
      This is a rare guarantee other libraries generally cannot give. In the standard
      configuration, the histogram <span class="bold"><strong>just works</strong></span> under
      any circumstance. Yet, users with unusual requirements can implement their
      own custom storage policy or use an alternative array-based storage policy.

        Parameters of interest, like the center of a distribution, can be extracted
        from the histogram instead of the original data set; statistical models can
        be fitted to histograms to the same end.
