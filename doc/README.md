# Building the documentation

For building the documentation, certain dependencies have to be installed and a user-config.jam has to be generated in the home directory.

See [Quickbook documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/doc/html/quickbook/install.html) for details.

In addition, b2 needs to be configured with Python support.

See [b2 documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/tools/build/doc/html/index.html#bbv2.reference.tools.libraries.python)
